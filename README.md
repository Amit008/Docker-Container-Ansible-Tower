# Docker-Container-Ansible-Tower

Was Trying out to Build Docker Container For Ansible Tower on Centos

To build this container have to make centos work with systemd which is a requirement to run ansible tower.

Centos is now providing Centos 7 image with Systemd which can be downloaded from docker hub

This is not offical Docker image from Ansible and this just for learning purpose how we can build Ansible Tower Container.
